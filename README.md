# Machine Learning Projects: Predictive Modeling  

## Project Overview  
This repository contains three machine learning projects focused on predictive modeling across different domains:  

1. **Obesity Risk Prediction** – A classification model that predicts the likelihood of obesity based on lifestyle, dietary habits, and physical activity data.  
2. **CO2 Emissions Prediction** – A regression model that estimates the CO2 emissions of vehicles using engine specifications and fuel consumption data.  
3. **Customer Churn Prediction (Telecom Industry)** – A classification model that predicts whether a telecom customer is likely to churn based on usage patterns, subscription details, and customer feedback.  

## Dataset and Methodology  
Each project is based on a structured dataset with relevant features. The workflow includes:  
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering  
- Model selection and training (classification or regression)  
- Performance evaluation using appropriate metrics  

## Usage  
The Jupyter Notebooks contain step-by-step implementations, including data analysis, visualization, model building, and evaluation. Run the notebooks to explore predictions and insights.  

## Applications  
These projects demonstrate the application of machine learning in health, environmental sustainability, and business analytics. They can be extended with more data and advanced models for improved accuracy.
