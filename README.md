# Machine Learning Projects: Predictive Modeling  

## Project Overview  
This repository contains three machine learning projects focused on predictive modeling across different domains:  

1. **Obesity Risk Prediction** – A classification model that predicts the likelihood of obesity based on lifestyle, dietary habits, and physical activity data.  
2. **CO2 Emissions Prediction** – A regression model that estimates the CO2 emissions of vehicles using engine specifications and fuel consumption data.  
3. **Customer Churn Prediction (Telecom Industry)** – A classification model that predicts whether a telecom customer is likely to churn based on usage patterns, subscription details, and customer feedback.  

## Dataset and Methodology  
Each project is based on a structured dataset with relevant features. The workflow includes:  
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering  
- Model selection and training (classification or regression)  
- Performance evaluation using appropriate metrics  

## Usage  
The Jupyter Notebooks contain step-by-step implementations, including data analysis, visualization, model building, and evaluation. Run the notebooks to explore predictions and insights.  

## Applications  
These projects demonstrate the application of machine learning in health, environmental sustainability, and business analytics. They can be extended with more data and advanced models for improved accuracy.  

# 1)Obesity Risk Prediction

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the risk of obesity using machine learning models. By analyzing various health-related factors, the model estimates an individual's likelihood of being classified into different obesity categories.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of features such as:
- Age
- Gender
- Dietary habits
- Physical activity levels
- Body measurements

These factors help in building a predictive model to assess obesity risks.

## Machine Learning Approach
The following techniques are used:
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Model training using classification algorithms
- Performance evaluation using accuracy, precision, and recall

## Usage
Run the Jupyter Notebook to preprocess data, train models, and analyze results.


# 2) Predicting CO2 Emissions of Unobserved Cars

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict the CO2 emissions of cars based on their specifications. The model provides emission estimates for unseen vehicle data, helping in environmental impact assessments.

## Dataset
The dataset includes attributes like:
- Engine size
- Fuel consumption
- Vehicle weight
- Number of cylinders

## Machine Learning Approach
The model is trained using:
- Regression techniques to predict emission levels
- Feature selection for optimizing model accuracy
- Evaluation using RMSE and R² scores

## Usage
Execute the Jupyter Notebook to preprocess data, train models, and generate predictions for unobserved cars.


# 3) Predicting Customer Churn in Telecom Industry

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting whether telecom customers are likely to churn (leave the service provider). By analyzing customer behavior and service usage, the model helps in customer retention strategies.

## Dataset
The dataset includes:
- Customer demographics
- Call and internet usage
- Subscription plans and tenure
- Customer complaints and feedback

## Machine Learning Approach
- Classification models for churn prediction
- Data preprocessing, including handling missing values
- Model evaluation using confusion matrix and F1-score

## Usage
Run the Jupyter Notebook to preprocess data, train the model, and analyze churn predictions.
